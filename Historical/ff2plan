Unique aspects of theme:
Insane insp.
Kefka prevents immediate connection.
Kefka/Kuja classic combo.

Problems we need to fix:
Seph is a bit unbalanced.
Judge/Yuna having factional kill.
Ult has won once like... ever, same as Seph. Imo they are fine it's just people playing the roles completely wrong. I for one, find those roles to be quite easy to win as.
Make sure village has to work to connect

IDEAS:
1. Moogles aren't useless (they weren't before, the vote always counts) (can we keep straight up vanillas I like being someone with no powers - in fact I prefer it to some mafias)
2. Maybe give the killers a one night no kill thingy- initialrecharge-yep (nerfing mafias????)
3. Unique roles to 35+ - Representation from all games.
4. Crystal Chronicle something (One moogle gets power to ward off poison off a specific group or something)
5. Monster Mafia
6. Generic PRs, like Mage or Warrior or Rogue that can upgrade, some representation of the early FF games - Proposed the Elemental Fiends from FFI as bonus characters in small games.
7. Paradigm Shift for Lightning, JOAT? I would vote no but I guess I don't know Lightning that well (haven't played a game of FF, let alone 13. Having her just kill is fine imo)
8. Possible original roles: Ramza Beoulve (Tactics), Luso Clemens (Tactics A2). 
9. 
10. 

----------------ROLES---------------

Village:
Villager: Moogle
**Special Villager: Boco the Chocobo (powers up Bartz if stalked, obviously something should prevent claiming)
**Inspector: Locke
**Insane Inspector: Zidane this is really going to fuck people up #freecactuar
**Variable Mayor: Ace
**Stalker: Bartz 
Revealing Samurai: Cloud
Vigilante: Squall - Gunblade pew pew oh wait yeah Squall is loooong overdue
**Safeguarder: Mog (massconvert safeguard? randomly protects X village members from poison, Crystal Chronicles reference)
**JOAT: Lightning (Commando: expose with expose.die on others, Ravager: nightkill, Sentinel: BG, Saboteur: poison, Syngergist: convert/buff, Medic: detox/revive?) - Not a real need for all those. Could be done like it was done in Duodecim, giving her Ravager, Sentinel and Medic which are her best Commandos. Could just use her first 3 classes before expansion. No need for a 3rd village BG (even if only 1 shotish)
**Bodyguard: Noctis (haxes kills, no names, no sides, only targets)
SelfBG: Cecil
Hooker: Yuna (Summons) or Lulu (Dolls)


Small Game Mafia: (Roles1)
Garlands still. Could add variety if Marilith, Tiamat, Kraken and Lich were added as "bonus" characters with a small chance of spawning instead of a Garland. No need for special powers really, just aesthetic value.


Mafia 1: "Kefkuja" (Roles1+) "Insane Kefka Posse" obviously
Kefka- pierce + prio kill convert > God Form Kefka and converts after Kuja dies. Gains additional votekill power well I'd say buff one or the other. I feel these guys win enough
Kuja- votekiller convert > Trance Form Kuja and converts after Kefka dies. Gains additional prio kill power Trance Kuja is p cool

Emperor Palamecia in big games maybe? So far no II representation. Trap master in Dissidia, could revenge inspects.

wow where is Cloud of Darkness and Exdeath

Mafia 2: Archadian Empire
Judge Gabranth: BG + 2 vote
Vayne: Night kill + Inspect
Dr. Cid: 1 shot lynch survival due to Famfrit, shared kill.
http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Cidolfus_Demen_Bunansa
Venat: Powers up team on death? Kinda like it did at the end of XII by fusing with Vayne. BG + SG for Gabranth, Inspect + Stalk for Vayne, 1 bulletproof for Cid, poison resistance for Zarga. - On the contrary, if every teammate dies before it can get something like exposing powers (tropius like?) + kill evasion, forcing to be voted out and gaining some way to get info.
http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Venat
Judge Zargabaath: Kill + Ignore protect, stalk, spies


Mafia 3: SOLDIER/Tsviets (Shinra?)
Sephiroth: non-revealing DK
Genesis: DK Immunity (mirroring Sephiroth?) - Something related to his clones? Though even a 1 time conversion could be pretty OP if not handled correctly.
http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Genesis_Rhapsodos
Weiss: Village-Bomb
http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Weiss_the_Immaculate
Jenova: Mole (morphing abilities).
Hojo: Poisoner (every 2 nights).

Not a fan of Seph's mafia team being too larg - ah fuck it. Note that mafia-sided bombs in the case of Weiss don't help their side to win at all really and the other mafias are more prone to come across him than Lightning/Squall are
IT would only bomb village though, could be justm ore of a side power oh I didn't know stuff like that existed o k cool :) I learned mafia bombs suck from Cake and Pokemon.


Solo 1:
Chaos (Dissidia): 

Slowly gains power through the cycle of battles, becoming more powerful each night. N2 gains a kill (30% piercing? Gains the piercing power and let him kill since n1?), N3 a minor voteshield (-2 or so, could increase too.), N4 a daykill... Like that, not necessarily those exact powers. Feral Chaos by N5 with increased piercing and voteshield seems a nice idea for me if the current powers are good enough.

Solo 2:
Caius (FF13-2): 
http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Caius_Ballad
Can only be affected by Lightning's actions, poison, -1 count, instead of a kill to make the safeguarders useful?
Time travel poison. Poisons you in the past so that you die in the present (!!)
maybe have him be able to BG/SG himself (even if only against Lightning....) due to just travel into the future to escape harm. (excuse me if that wouldn't work in the FF universe or w/e, I dont play FF so I wouldn't know)
Anti-Lightning role, revenges Expose, immune to other stuff or maybe revenges
making the village too reliant on Lightning??? I mean of course he can still be lynched but your first sentence gives me the idea that he avoids inspects too (ok he can get crossfired but that's really not a good idea imo)
yeah I suppose the FF13-2 villain would be better because Orphan = ?????

hey I like Ultimecia being Solo  too :(
    
just realized Seph's side would basically take over Sin (who is a bit lame I will admit)
