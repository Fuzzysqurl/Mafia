How to use the Testing Script:

1. Open your copy of Mafia.js
2. Add the first block of code somewhere around the line for "var border". I usually place it right after that group of variables.
3. Add the second block of code in the same section as the command for "slay" (if you want MAs to be able to do it) or right after "updateafter" (if you want it restricted to sMAs). You can add it anywhere in the command sections, but its easier to have a specific place to point to
4. Save the script, and update on your server.

Client Script information:

The client script is a fork of Crystal Moogle's client scripts with the addition of an Anti-Caps mute script. What it does is forces your messages to be lowercase if it would have caused a caps mute. It is highly recommended to restart your client after changing the script so it syncs properly with the server.
