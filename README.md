Mafia
=====

How to use the Testing Script:

1. Open your copy of Mafia.js
2. Add the first block of code somewhere around the line for "var border". I usually place it right after that group of variables.
3. Add the second block of code in the same section as the command for "slay" (if you want MAs to be able to do it) or right after "updateafter" (if you want it restricted to sMAs). You can add it anywhere in the command sections, but its easier to have a specific place to point to
4. Save the script, and update on your server.
