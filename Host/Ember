    "changelog": {
        "December 14, 2013": "Lots of things changed. Roles may be drastically altered, hax/failchances removed, Mega Charizard Y now has Drought which is a massconvert action, Steelix now has an evade charge on kill due to Sturdy, etc.",
        "December 15, 2013": "Magbies are now Magmars. This is for a new edit that might make it's way into the game depending on the balance. :)",
        "December 21, 2013": "Winter solstace today. Added Delphox. Slaves ignore shield. Teamtalk added. Heatran now bypasses all modes for his power command. Ninetales now has an initialrecharge of 3 for his drought. Volcanion now has a 50% chance of knowing who Magcargoes/Magmars are. Volcanion now has a Scald which is a poison that automatically kills Heatran if it hits. Volcanion can be daykilled now (except in Drought form)",
        "December 22, 2013": "Added Vulpix, Growlithe, Fennekin, Charmander, Braixen, Charmeleon, Houndour, and Magby. The middle evolutions and Vulpix, Growlithe, and Houndour have a 1-shot command that their evolutions have. The baby Pokemon have 0 votes and +1 voteshield.",
        "December 24, 2013": "Happy new year's eve! I mean, um, christmas eve! :) Put some onDeath roles for when Volcanion dies. His minions won't be entirely useless when he's gone. Machamp is now known as Infernape, because it didn't really fit with the theme.",
        "December 25, 2013": "Merry christmas. Bug fixes, with Volcanion's onDeath and stuff like that. Grammar fixes as well. I missed a lot of logs, working on making Volcanion and Geodude Army more buff. Took out recharges from Ninetales, Arcanine and Houndoom.",
        "December 26, 2013": "Gave Golem and Steelix lines chances to spawn with either Rock Head or Sturdy. Gave Volcanion 3 votes (5 in drought), a self-protect once per game, and his convert protects his target too.",
        "December 27, 2013": "Added Volcarona, who can inspect to see if a Pokemon is a Rock-type or not twice per game. Added Carbink, same as Volcarona but with Steels instead. Heatran now has two daykills in both forms.",
        "December 30, 2013": "Pushed Heatran deeper into spawn. Forfeited Onix and Steelix's abilities during small games. Geodude still has theirs though.",
        "January 7, 2014": "Victini added for small games only. The x-shot roles that appear in bigger games of like 30 or whatever because I'm too lazy to check the spawn on the checker are now in small games and can have their action drained by Victini or replenished by Vulpix. Team-reveal was given to Onix's team as well as teamtalk.",
        "January 9, 2014": "Two Charizards are in the game now! One actually has a dummy command, and doesn't protect (they have the same command and it's shared btw, the function is different). When their partner and Arcanine dies, they become a Mega Charizard Y. When their partner and Blaziken dies, they become a Mega Charizard X. Mega Charizard X is a vigilante role with an unstoppable kill (unless he doesn't use it ofc lol.) Mega Blaziken removed. Spawn slightly adjusted.",
        "January 10, 2014": "silentCopy boolean added to all x-shot roles. Onix added to a list of roles Victini can drain actions from. Charmeleon no longer protects in his used form (which was an accident to begin with). Later: fixed Infernape's daykill bomb message. Gave Arcanine a voteshield instead of extra votes (-2).",
        "January 12, 2014": "Added Mega Charizard X to vclr. Fixed his help message and info as well. Januaray is now january b/c my gramr skillz sux. Later: silent boolean added. This fixes problems where it says 'X has been converted into an X!'",
        "March 31, 2014": "Added Mega Magcargo (joke role), Magmortar and Mega Houndoom."
