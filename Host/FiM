    "changelog": {
        "June 14, 2012": "Changelog added. Derpy now wins with ANY team if she makes it to the end, and can no longer poison during the night. Cutie Mark Crusaders now expose instead of kill during the day. Priorities updated.",
        "June 16, 2012": "Derpy no longer kills distractors, and has a 10% chance of avoiding daykills, nightkills, and poison. Priorities updated.",
        "June 30, 2012": "Discord appears much earlier. Derpy can only safeguard once, but now has a 50% chance of evading poison, and a 15% chance of evading day and nightkills. The Diamond Dogs know each other's roles.",
        "August 6, 2012": "Pinkie Pie reveals daykillers instead of avoiding them. Flutterhax reduced.",
        "August 7, 2012": "Queen Chrysalis can now chrysalize once per game, an insta-killing poison. Team hax added for Parasprites and Changelings and increased for Chrysalis, Discord, and Cadance.",
        "August 13, 2012": "All the Diamond Dogs get a custom broadcast command whenever someone on the team acts.",
        "August 15, 2012": "The Great and Powerful Trixie has been added as a lone role.",
        "September 11, 2012": "Cadance appears at first instead of Chrysalis. /Chrysalize no longer pierces through bodyguards.",
        "September 14, 2012": "Applejack broadcasts /buck (now once every other night). Trixie can no longer /teleport and only has a 20% of avoiding all harm. She converts into The Greater and More Powerful Trixie upon being lynched. Doctor Hooves and Pinkie Pie get hax on feedoff.",
        "September 17, 2012": "Applejack may now use each of the following commands once per game- buck, inspect, distract, protect, and safeguard. Chrysalis's consume is now a poison, and she has a voteshield of -4. Win messages added.",
        "September 21, 2012": "Derpy can /derp at night to use a random command. Princesses avoid poison 15% of the time.",
        "September 23, 2012": "Roles list updated. Pinkie Pie appears instead of Applejack in smaller games. Fido appears after Discord. Fido may use capture once per game without an initial recharge.",
        "October 4, 2012": "Berry Punch appears instead of Pinkie in small games. Applejack appears after Discord.",
        "October 30, 2012": "Celestia has a voteshield of -999. The Greater and More Powerful Trixie wins if killing roles (and Celestia) are gone; her avoid rate is lowered to 40%. Pinkie no longer gets hax on consume or feedoff; Rarity does instead. Applejack must wait one turn before using her commands. Parasprites cannot be poisoned. Derpy may appear on Trixie's side, and /derp has a higher chance of failing.",
        "November 9, 2012": "Applejack can no longer change targets for her commands (cuz she's honest), and /buck is now a two-time priority distract/kill. Initial recharge removed.",
        "December 4, 2012": "Added in Babs Seed to Cutie Mark Crusaders. They have 2 votes now, but reveal themselves 15% of the time when using /squee. Chrysalis's poison goes through protect. Rover has a 20% chance of inspecting incorrectly.",
        "January 3, 2013": "Princess Luna gets -997 votes to balance out Celestia's 999. Celestia cannot be poisoned by Changelings. Changelings avoid distract only 50% of the time. Chrysalis can't be distracted. Zecora delayed :(.",
        "February 2, 2013": "Finally added Zecora. She starts out invulnerable to every command. After 2 turns, she can choose to join a side and then assist them with potions and poisons. Or, after 6 turns, she can go alone and revenge every command used against her, as well as use a 3 turn poison against everyone.",
        "February 5, 2013": "Zecora converts on the 5th night, and has a 1 day poison. Celestia gets 1 daykill instead of nightkills after Luna is gone. Added in new villagers and made some random. Added a roles3 list.",

        "July 4, 2013": "Balance update. See the thread for details: http://pokemon-online.eu/forums/showthread.php?15907-FiM.",
        "August 25, 2013": "The villagers ponies now don't know their real name until day 3 and both them and changeling get inspected as Pony instead of a more precise pony.",
        "August 27, 2013": "Added Snips,Snails and King Sombra as roles.",
		"December 27, 2013": "Added Brony.",
		"February 21, 2014": "Now baddies and Masons can Team-Talk.",
		"February 26, 2014": "Fixed the bug where Brony win even if village can still fight back. Now Brony starts with only -1.1 voteshield that rises of -1 every time that they convert a villager."
