All is peaceful, but when the Emperor's Army threatens to conquer the town, it's up to the Oracles and Genies to fight back! Use the Oracles' deaths and Genies' wishes to find and kill enemies. Oracles can receive and use unlimited wishes if they /see every night, but all other roles are limited to a maximum of two. And the Army now has teamtalk! Only to be played in nonpeak times, from 3 to 12 players.",
