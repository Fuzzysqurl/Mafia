Added Shiny Rotom as a test (Shiny Rotom is alone and can't inspect, but can nightkill, daykill, poison and demote. Shiny also pierces BG, ignores Distract and inspects as normal Rotom).",
        "13.02.2014": "Added important note the the summary stating that joining only to die N1 will be considered trolling (authorized by Fuzzy). It hinders the game for people who actually want to play and messes the mafia stats/win data.",

Mow's voteshield changed to -19. Mow no longer evades distract. Mow's kill is now faster than Heat's poison again. This update is experimental and has a high chance of being reverted if things doesn't work, so don't freak about those changes.",
