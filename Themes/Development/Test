The Village must stop the Mafia from controlling the town while being careful not to lynch the Lynchee, otherwise the Lyncher will win! If the Lynchee is killed at night, the Lyncher joins the Village to take out the common enemy: The Mafia. The game simulates daystart and the Mafia cannot kill night 1. For 3-10 players (non-peak).",
