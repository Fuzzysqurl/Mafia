		"4/5/2013": "Replaced Phione with a fake Suicune. Added Moltres and Zapdos as spys that hax other actions. Genesect now reveals as Shedinja. Genesect goes rogue after being lynched and teams up with Shedinja. Little bugs restructured in medium games. Zoroark evades daykills. Nerfed Meloetta as 2 distracts was very townsided. Meloetta replaced by Shaymin in games under 10 players. Meloetta gets proper reveal on Thundurus now. Arceus and Zoroark kill message clarified to prevent confusion. Spinarak's poison split into 2 actions following village nerfs. Eevee given ability to convert randomly if they want. Sides/Priority shortened where applicable. Rayquaza/Farfetch'd help updated to tell they can kill Shedinja. Genesect no longer nightbombs unless in second form and only bombs Rayquaza. Genesect removed from VCLR. Little Bugs renamed Bugs. Shedinja wins with Bugs now."
